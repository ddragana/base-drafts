## Following Discussion

The Working Group has a few venues for discussion:

* We plain to meet at all [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/) for the foreseeable future, and hold interim meetings between them, at least through 2017. See our [meeting materials repository](https://github.com/quicwg/wg-materials) and the [official proceedings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/meetings/).

* Our [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic) is used for most communication, including notifications of meetings, new drafts, consensus calls and other business, as well as issue discussion.

* We also discuss specific issues on the appropriate issues list in [Github](https://github.com/quicwg/). If you don't want to use Github to follow these discussions, you can subscribe to the [issue announce list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic-issues).

To be active in the Working Group, you can participate in any of these places. Most activity takes
place on the mailing list, but if you just want to comment on and raise issues, that's fine too.


## Raising Issues

We use our [Github](https://github.com/quicwg/) issues lists to track items for discussion and
their resolution.

Before filing a new issue, please consider a few things:

* Issues should be just that; issues with our deliverables, **not questions or support requests**.
* Please review the issues list to make sure that you aren't filing a duplicate.
* If you're not sure how to phrase your issue, please ask on the [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic).

Issues can also be raised on the [Working Group mailing
list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic) by clearly marking them as such (e.g., "New
Issue" in the `Subject:` line).

Be aware that issues might be rephrased, changed in scope, or combined with others, so that the
group can focus its efforts. If you feel that such a change loses an important part of your
original issue, please bring it up, either in comments or on the list.

Off-topic and duplicate issues will be closed without discussion. Note that comments on individual
commits will only be responded to with best effort, and may not be seen.


## Resolving Issues

The `open` issues in the issues list are those that we are currently or plan to discuss. When an issue is `closed`, it implies that the group has consensus and it is reflected in the draft(s). If substantive new information is brought to our attention, issues can be reopened by the Chairs.

Issues will be labeled by the Chairs as either `editorial` or `design`.

* **Design** issues require discussion and consensus in the Working Group. This discussion can happen both in the issue and on the [Working Group mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic), as outlined below.

* **Editorial** issues can be closed by the editor(s) without consensus or notification. Typically, any discussion will take place on the issue itself.

Consensus for the resolution of a design issue can be established in a few different ways:

* Through discussion on the mailing list. Once a resolution is found, it will be recorded in the issue.

* Through discussion on the issues list. Once a resolution is found, it will be confirmed on the mailing list before consensus is declared.

The editors can also propose resolutions for the group's consideration by incorporating them into the draft(s); when doing so, the issue should not be closed until consensus is declared.

Issues that have consensus but which aren't yet reflected in text will be labelled as `editor-ready`. After the editors have incorporated a resolution into the specification, the issue can be closed.

When a new draft is published, the design issues that have been closed since the last draft will be highlighted on the mailing list, to aid reviewers.

### Discretionary Design Issue Labels

We also use the following labels to help understand the state of our design issues:

* **Needs Discussion**: The issue needs significant Working Group discussion before it can progress.
* **Confirm Consensus**: There is a resolution that the proponents believe reflects a consensus position, needs to be confirmed with the WG.
* **Notify Consensus**: The WG has achieved consensus in a meeting, needs to be confirmed on the mailing list.


## Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests, both for editorial suggestions and to resolve open issues. In the latter
case, please identify the relevant issue.

Please do not use a pull request to open a new design issue; it may not be noticed.


## Code of Conduct

The [IETF Guidelines for Conduct](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7154) applies to all Working Group
communications and meetings.
